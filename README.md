# ðŸŽˆ Gods Eye Object Detection

A simple Security Detection app template for you to modify and use! We have color palettes to prevent eye strain, as well as useful metrics to track detections

### Public Server

We maintain a public server running through Streamlit, yet due to bandwidth concerns, the server will routinely shut off leaving the website unreliable. Try out the website, see if its up. If not, feel free to follow the instructions towards downloading the codebase yourself.  

### How to run it on your own machine

1. Clone the repository

   ```
   $ git clone <repositoryclonesshkey>
   ```

2. Switch to the 'finalfunctions' branch

   ```
   $ git checkout finalfunctions
   ```

3. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
